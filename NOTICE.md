## Third-party dependencies are grouped below by license.

Each table row lists a package used by this project, along with its version, ecosystem, role (runtime or dev), copyright holder/author, and upstream source.

This inventory was generated from real package metadata: `pip-licenses` (run via `uv run --with pip-licenses`) against the project virtual environment for Python packages (direct and transitive), and `uv tree --no-dev` to distinguish runtime from dev dependencies.

A few packages resolved in `uv.lock` are platform- or Python-version-conditional and are not installed in this environment, so they are not inventoried below:

- `colorama` — installed only on Windows.
- `tzdata` and `pytz` — pandas timezone data, pulled in only where the system lacks its own zoneinfo.
- `typing_extensions` — back-ports for older Python versions.
- `exceptiongroup` and `tomli` — dev/test back-ports for Python < 3.11.

**Dual-licensed and multi-licensed packages** — the following packages declare more than one license:

- `cffi` — MIT-0 (MIT No Attribution; listed under MIT No Attribution License).
- `cryptography` — Apache-2.0 **OR** BSD-3-Clause (listed under Apache License 2.0).
- `numpy` — BSD-3-Clause **AND** 0BSD **AND** MIT **AND** Zlib **AND** CC0-1.0 (combined work; listed under BSD 3-Clause License).
- `packaging` — Apache-2.0 **OR** BSD-2-Clause (listed under Apache License 2.0).
- `python-dateutil` — Apache-2.0 **OR** BSD-3-Clause (listed under Apache License 2.0).
