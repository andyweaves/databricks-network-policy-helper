"""Databricks authentication via the SDK's unified auth.

Workspace calls resolve credentials from the usual chain (a `--profile` in ~/.databrickscfg,
`DATABRICKS_*` env vars, or OAuth). Account-level calls (creating/assigning a policy, SCIM identity
resolution) need an **account admin**; the recommended path is an account-admin service principal via
OAuth M2M, configured in the same profile/env — see docs/account-admin-setup.md. We don't invent a
bespoke secret path: whatever the SDK's unified auth resolves for the account is used.
