"""SQL against the Databricks system tables.

IP parsing/versioning/range-membership can use the DBSQL INET built-ins (`try_ip_host`,
`ip_version`, `ip_cidr_contains`, `try_ip_cidr`) — fast, but a **non-public preview**: a warehouse
without them raises `INET_FUNCTIONS_NOT_ENABLED` (`ip_cidr_contains is disabled or unsupported. INET
functions are not publicly available yet.`). So every builder here takes `use_inet`:

  * use_inet=True  → the native INET builtins (the fast path; used by default).
  * use_inet=False → a portable regex/`split`-based parse + integer range checks that runs on any
    warehouse (the fallback).

The caller probes support once (see `INET_PROBE`) and picks the mode. Either way `core/ingress.py`
re-parses every candidate with the stdlib `ipaddress` module, so the SQL only has to be good enough
to filter, version, and aggregate.

The notebook staged an `audit_recent` temp view and read it repeatedly; over a stateless SQL
connection we inline that as a CTE / base subquery instead, so each query is self-contained.
