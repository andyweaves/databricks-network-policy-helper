"""Use the operating system's trust store for TLS verification.

In corporate environments a TLS-inspecting proxy presents certificates signed by an internal root CA
that lives in the OS trust store but *not* in certifi's bundle. The Databricks SDK happens to read
the system store, but `databricks-sql-connector` and `urllib` (used for feed downloads) default to
certifi — so they fail with CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED while the SDK works.

`truststore` makes Python's `ssl` module verify against the OS trust store, fixing every consumer at
once with no env-var fiddling. We call `enable()` once at CLI startup. It's best-effort: if
`truststore` is unavailable or the platform is unsupported, we leave the default (certifi) behaviour
in place, and users can still fall back to SSL_CERT_FILE / REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE.
