"""Tag every Databricks SDK request with this tool's name, for usage tracking.

The Databricks SDK appends registered "user-agent extras" to the `User-Agent` header of every API
call it makes. Registering the project name lets platform-side logs attribute API traffic to this
tool. Granularity is **workspace-level** — the cluster/DBU attribution isn't available (cluster ids
are redacted in the logs), so per-DBU attribution isn't possible; the tool name in the User-Agent is
the signal.

Called once at CLI startup, before any WorkspaceClient / AccountClient is constructed (the SDK reads
the registered extras when it builds a client's config).
